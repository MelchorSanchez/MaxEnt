MaxEnt
======

MaxEnt is a script that re-weights a set of structures to fit a given set of Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDC) values. It is based on a Maximum Entropy principle. 
MaxEnt needs as inputs a matrix of MxN and a vector of N values. The MxN matrix should contain the N RDCs of the M structures in thet set, and the second vector should contain the experimental or objetive RDCs.
The RDCs will be scaled to fit the experimental RDCs.
To simplify the generation of RDCs from a set of PDB structures, we provide the python scripy RunPales.py.

RunPales
========

RunPales is an script that execute the PALES (http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/software/PALES/) pales-linux to
generate RDCs from PDB files.
